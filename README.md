This project aims to compute spectrum slot allocation and shortest path between nodes in a network using a graph-based model. In real-world optical or wireless communication networks, resources like bandwidth or frequency slots need to be allocated efficiently between nodes. The challenge lies in finding optimal paths between nodes and assigning available spectrum slots (either contiguous or non-contiguous) while avoiding congestion. This project provides a visual and interactive way to understand and test such allocation strategies.
The project is built using Python’s tkinter for GUI, networkx for graph handling, and matplotlib for visualization. Users can create nodes and edges (with weights), specify source and destination nodes, and define the number of slots required. The tool then computes shortest paths using two different algorithms—Dijkstra and A*. It attempts to allocate slots along the chosen paths, preferring contiguous allocations but optionally allowing non-contiguous ones. 
Internally, the tool maintains a slot table for each edge to track slot usage across the network. During allocation, it checks for available slots across all edges in a path and marks them as used upon success. The visual feedback and performance timings for each algorithm provide a hands-on way to compare efficiency and allocation success.
